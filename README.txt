Three Tier Distributed Web Application. Capstone project for CNT 4714 at UCF Screenshots are in the screenshots folder.

Hi there, this project was developed in an IDE, as such I'm not sure about its portability. Netbeans sort of just works with the directory structure in the project.

Screenshots are in the top level in a folder by the same name.
